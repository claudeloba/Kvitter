# Twitter Clone: Kvitter

Made with bootstrap, scss & JavaScript.

## How to:

npm install for dependencies

### Thoughts:

How we would improve the project:

Divide the HTML into JSX components (React).

Fetch real tweets with Twitter API.

### Features:

Accessbility. Tab through the elements.
ARIA.
Responsibility. (Icons switch based on screen size. (Discover turns into Search, etc.))
